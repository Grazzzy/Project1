                <p class="ellipsis">Cacti are native through most of the length of North and South America, from British Columbia and Alberta southward; the southernmost limit of their range extends far into Chile and Argentina. Mexico has the greatest number and variety of species.
                  The only cacti possibly native to the Old World are members of the tropical genus Rhipsalis, occurring in East Africa, Madagascar, and Sri Lanka.

                <p class="ellipsis">Cacti are succulent perennial plants. Although a few species inhabit tropical or subtropical areas, most live in and are well adapted to dry regions. Cacti generally have thick herbaceous or woody chlorophyll-containing stems. In most species
                  leaves are either absent or greatly reduced, minimizing the amount of surface area from which water can be lost, and the stem has taken over the photosynthetic functions of the plant. Only the tropical genera Pereskia and Pereskopsis, both vines,
                  have conventional-looking functional leaves, while the leaves of the Andean Maihuenia are rounded, not flattened. The root systems are generally thin, fibrous, and shallow, ranging widely to absorb superficial moisture.</p>

                <h1>WHERE DOES PLASTIC POLLUTION GO?</h1>
                <p class="ellipsis">Cacti are widely cultivated as ornamentals. In addition, various species, notably prickly pears and chollas (both Opuntia), are cultivated as food. In South America species of Opuntia, Cereus, and others are used as living fences, and wood from
                  columnar cacti is used as fuel in some desert regions. Barrel cacti (Echinocactus and Ferocactus) are a source of water in emergencies. Peyote, from Lophophora williamsii, has been used ceremonially since pre-Columbian times for its hallucinogenic
                  properties.</p>

                <p>Plastic leaks into the ocean from thousands of sources all over the world every day. Increasing consumption combined with improper waste management in many countries has made plastic pollution a worldwide problem, causing damage not only to the environment but also to human health and economies.</p>

            <div class="Article-card"><h2>HOW DOES PLASTIC ENTER THE OCEAN?</h2>
                <p>Plastic usage and waste management infrastructures differ all over the world. Only 9% gets recycled, and about 22% of plastic waste worldwide is either not collected, improperly disposed of, or ends up as litter.</p>

            <div class="Article-card"><h2>WHERE DOES PLASTIC POLLUTION GO?</h2>
                <p>Nearly half of the plastic sinks directly because of its low buoyancy. Of the other half which floats, our research shows most of it doesn’t go far out in the ocean — about 80% of floating plastic will beach on a coastline within a month of leaking into the ocean. Some objects may be washed out to sea again, but coastlines are the final resting place for most floating ocean plastic.</p>
